Finished set of files for the Tom Dale Tutorial
at [Building an App with Ember.js](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=Ga99hMi7wfY)
including a couple fixture records.

See article and live example at [Ember.js Hello World](http://www.railsonmaui.com/http://octopress.dev/blog/2013/05/26/learning-ember-dot-js/).

Only differeces are:
1. Slight bit of styling added in style.css
2. Moved fixtures to separate file.
